 * Name: umm_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is a simple wrapper for the mm_initialize() function.  This
 *   function will initialize the user heap.
 *
 *   CONFIG_BUILD_FLAT:
 *     There is only kernel mode "blob" containing both containing both
 *     kernel and application code.  There is only one heap that use is
 *     used by both the kernel and application logic.
 *
 *     In this configuration, this function is called early in os_start()
 *     to initialize the common heap.
 *
 *   CONFIG_BUILD_PROTECTED
 *     In this configuration, there are two "blobs", one containing
 *     protected kernel logic and one containing unprotected application
 *     logic.  Depending upon the setting of CONFIG_MM_KERNEL_HEAP there
 *     may be only a signal shared heap, much as with CONFIG_BUILD_FLAT.
 *     Or there may be separate protected/kernel and unprotected/user
 *     heaps.
 *
 *     In either case, this function is still called early in os_start()
 *     to initialize the user heap.
 *
 *   CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL
 *     In this configuration there are multiple user heaps, one for each
 *     user process.  Furthermore, each heap is initially empty; memory
 *     is added to each heap dynamically via sbrk().  The heap data
 *     structure was set to zero when the address environment was created.
 *     Otherwise, the heap is uninitialized.
 *
 *     This function is not called at all.  Rather, this function is called
 *     when each user process is created before the first allocation is made.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   heap_start - Address of the beginning of the (initial) memory region
 *   heap_size  - The size (in bytes) if the (initial) memory region.
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   None

 * Name: sbrk
 *
 * Description:
 *    The sbrk() function is used to change the amount of space allocated
 *    for the calling process. The change is made by resetting the process'
 *    break value and allocating the appropriate amount of space.  The amount
 *    of allocated space increases as the break value increases.
 *
 *    The sbrk() function adds 'incr' bytes to the break value and changes
 *    the allocated space accordingly. If incr is negative, the amount of
 *    allocated space is decreased by incr bytes. The current value of the
 *    program break is returned by sbrk(0).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *    incr - Specifies the number of bytes to add or to remove from the
 *      space allocated for the process.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *    Upon successful completion, sbrk() returns the prior break value.
 *    Otherwise, it returns (void *)-1 and sets errno to indicate the
 *    error:
 *
 *      ENOMEM - The requested change would allocate more space than
 *        allowed under system limits.
 *      EAGAIN - The total amount of system memory available for allocation
 *        to this process is temporarily insufficient. This may occur even
 *        though the space requested was less than the maximum data segment
 *        size.
